/**
 * Fallout 4 Pip-Boy CRT effect.
 *
 * Reproduces the brightness behaviour of Bethesda's PipboyPostEffect shader
 * (the green phosphor screen) natively on the stick LEDs, so they breathe and
 * stutter in the same character as the in-game screen — without any per-frame
 * IPC from the companion app (which provably disturbs the Unity renderer).
 *
 * Formula (extracted from Assembly-CSharp PipboyPostEffect.Update):
 *
 *   fBrightness = 1.0 + perlin(t * 0.5) * 0.5            // slow phosphor pulse
 *   if flickering:
 *       fBrightness += perlin(t * 22) - 0.1             // fast CRT shimmer
 *   flicker scheduling: idle Random(5..15)s, burst Random(0.1..0.6)s
 *
 * Two faithful adaptations for the LEDs:
 *   1. The pulse (1.0..1.5 on screen, a multiplier) is normalised to a
 *      0.5..1.0 LED envelope so the breath never goes fully dark.
 *   2. The flicker is applied as a DOWNWARD stutter only (per the device
 *      owner's directive: "make flicker step down rather than up"). On screen
 *      the fast perlin term can brighten; on the sticks a momentary dimming
 *      reads as the authentic CRT stutter and never overshoots the baseline.
 *
 * The pulse is deterministic in t, so feeding a shared phase origin
 * (setPhaseOrigin) aligns the sticks with the screen. The flicker is random
 * by design and is reproduced statistically, not phase-locked.

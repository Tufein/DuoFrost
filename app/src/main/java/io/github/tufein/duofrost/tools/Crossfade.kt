/**
 * Pure timing math for the dip-to-black crossfade used when an LED override
 * reverts to the underlying animation.
 *
 *   phase 1 (0 .. outMs)            scale ramps 1 → 0   (outgoing dims out)
 *   midpoint (== outMs)            scale 0, animation swap happens here
 *   phase 2 (outMs .. outMs+inMs)  scale ramps 0 → 1   (incoming fades up)
 *   after                          scale 1             (fade complete)
 *
 * Extracted from LEDService so the curve is unit-testable without the Android
 * handler / LED binder.
